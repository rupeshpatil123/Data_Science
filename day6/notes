### methods for splitting data into (training, testing/validation)

train_test_split : stratified ratio-based direct splitting. gives only 1 set each for training & testing 

Kfold : split the data K times. Gives K set each for training & testing

Note: In a single iteration, same data point cannot be used for training & testing set

Approach 1: Take a fixed ratio of training & testing set. Perform stratification if applicable. (train_test_split)
            Get one set each for training & testing


Approach 2: Split the data randomly in a specified ratio BUT MULTIPLE TIMES. Train & test multiple times  (Cross validation)


    300 rows

    cycle 1:    rows 1, 3,4,511...training & remaining testing


Approach 3: Let's divide data into K FOLDS                             [KFOLD]

A        B           C         D              E
1-60    61-120     121-180    181-240      241-300

                Training             Testing
cycle 1     A,B,C,D                    E
cycle 2     A,D,E,C                    B
cycle 3     A,E,B,C                    D



Approach 4 : Let's divide data into K FOLDS. ENSURE EACH FOLD IS STRATIFIED [STRATIFIED K_FOLD SAMPLING]

A        B           C         D              E
1-60    61-120     121-180    181-240      241-300

                Training             Testing
cycle 1     A,B,C,D                    E
cycle 2     A,D,E,C                    B
cycle 3     A,E,B,C                    D
