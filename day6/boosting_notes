ENSEMBLE


BAGGING ENSEMBLE(for e.g: RANDOM FOREST)

    -ask multiple models trained/tuned in different ways for an answer. Go with majority



BOOSTING ENSEMBLE(for e.g : XGBOOST MODEL)

        -send all rows of data to the first model in the ensemble. You get answers back.
        Some are right, some are wrong.

        - Make the next model of the ensemble focus on inaccurate classification made
        by the current model


                     FIRST MODEL              SECOND MODEL                 THIRD MODEL
        1000 rows:    900 rows right     ---->100 rows input-------->        30 rows
                                             70 correct, 30 incorrect
